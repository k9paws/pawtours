                                We like to call if comfort camping! We use 3-4 person tents to ensure there is lots of
                                space and headroom, so you don't
                                feel cramped. There are also two doors and two separate areas for luggage to be kept, so
                                it is very easy and comfortable
                                to share a tent with someone. We pair two campers in a 3 person tent, or 3 campers in a
                                4 person tent, to ensure there
                                is lots of space.
                                <br><br>
                                Our sleeping pads are second to none. They are nice and wide, and over 6 feet long to
                                ensure you have plenty of space.
                                They inflate to 3 inches (7.5 cm) thick and you can opt to inflate it so it is firm or
                                soft, depending on how you like
                                it. The top of the mattress is a soft fabric to increase comfort as well. With these
                                mattresses you can sleep on rocks
                                and roots and not feel a thing, but we won't make you do that!

                                It is common for first time guests to be concerned that they will have a hard time
                                camping, with sore backs etc. We have
                                actually never had someone on a cmaping tour that was uncomfortable and everyone has
                                been pleasantly surprised at how
                                comfortable they were while camping.

                                The food is one of the best parts of our camping tours. Your guides go to great lengths
                                to bring high quality groceries,
                                much of which is organic and locally grown. You will likely be surprised what we cook up
                                for you. Some examples include:
                                Grilled salmon with asparagus and pesto pasta, tequila lime shrimp tacos with mango
                                slaw, tender grilled steaks with
                                roasted veggies and potatoes.

                                Have a tricky diet? Don't sweat! We are probably the best company around at providing a
                                top notch menu and we can cater
                                to almost any diet. Many of our guides are vegans, or gluten free themselves, so it's
                                pretty normal for us. We can
                                accommodate vegan/ vegetarian, gluten free, kosher, halaal, wheat free, lactose
                                intolerant and whatever else you can
                                think of.

                                while others can relax and enjoy the scenery. With two guides we can ensure that you are

                                Typical hikes are between 4 km (2 miles) and 16 km (10 miles), with moderate elevation
                                gain (250-600 meters/ 500- 2000
                                feet). If you are wondering, you will be totally fine if you are able to go out for a
                                brisk walk and hold conversation.
                                Roughly 98 percent of our guests just like you have been comfortably able to do the
                                hiking on these tours.
